I recently got quizzed by a chap from Microsoft about which gear I use for development workflows, and I found the concept of these *Uses* pages. So here is mine.


## Hardware

- Primary Desktop: 
    - [An old HP Z800, with dual 6-core Xeons, 48GB RAM and a Nvidia GTX 980 Ti](https://www8.hp.com/uk/en/workstations/product-details/3718645)
- Desktop Monitors:
    - [Two Dell UltraSharp 24" 1200p displays (U2412M)](https://deals.dell.com/mpp/productdetail/204g)
- Keyboard:
    - [Logitech MK520](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/wireless-combo-mk520)
- Mouse:
    - [Logitech MX Performance](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Performance-Wireless-Mouse-version/dp/B002L3TSKC)
- Desk:
    - [Oak Kitchen Worktop](https://www.worktop-express.co.uk/)
    - [6x Ikea ADILS legs (black)](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/adils-leg-black-70217973/)

## Editor & IDE

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my go to choice for anything that is not full-fat .NET Framework. JavaScript/TypeScript, Markdown, HTML, PowerShell is all done in VS Code. I use [Sarah Drasner's](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) [Night Owl theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) and various extensions. But I do use the Visual Studio Keymap.
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) has to be used for anything for the full .NET Framework. It has git integration but I prefer the streamlined version in VSCode.
